This project is motivated by publicly available open-source crime data sets. In recent years, researchers have extensively used machine learning and data mining techniques in the crime analysis arena to extract association rules, frequent patterns, clusters, or correlations. Machine learning and prediction models have been used to classify patterns to predict future crime variables.
